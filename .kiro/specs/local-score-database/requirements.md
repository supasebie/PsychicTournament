# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a local database using sqflite to persistently store user game scores and detailed game session data. The system will capture and store comprehensive game information including session metadata, individual turn results, and performance statistics. This will enable users to track their psychic abilities over time and review historical game sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game scores to be automatically saved to a local database, so that I can track my performance over time without losing data when the app is closed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game session is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically save the game data to the local sqflite database
2. WHEN the app is restarted THEN previously saved game data SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN a game is saved THEN the system SHALL store the session ID, date/time, coordinates, game results, and hit count
4. IF the database save operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue normal app operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view a history of my past game sessions, so that I can analyze my psychic performance trends and see detailed results from previous games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the game history THEN the system SHALL display a list of all saved game sessions
2. WHEN viewing game history THEN each entry SHALL show the date, time, coordinates, and final score
3. WHEN I select a specific game session THEN the system SHALL display the detailed turn-by-turn results
4. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the results SHALL be sorted by date with most recent games first

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see statistics about my overall performance, so that I can understand my psychic abilities and track improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my statistics THEN the system SHALL display total games played, average score, and best score
2. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show hit rate percentage across all games
3. WHEN I have played multiple games THEN the system SHALL display performance trends over time
4. IF no games have been played THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the ability to delete old game records, so that I can manage my stored data and remove sessions I no longer want to keep.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing game history THEN I SHALL be able to delete individual game sessions
2. WHEN I delete a game session THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently from the database
3. WHEN deleting a session THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before proceeding
4. WHEN a session is deleted THEN the statistics SHALL be updated to reflect the removal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be properly structured and maintainable, so that the system can handle data efficiently and support future enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first launches THEN the system SHALL create the database tables if they don't exist
2. WHEN storing game results THEN the system SHALL use normalized data structures for efficient storage
3. WHEN the database schema needs updates THEN the system SHALL handle migrations gracefully
4. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game data to be stored locally on my device, so that my personal game history remains private and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game data is saved THEN it SHALL be stored only on the local device using sqflite
2. WHEN the device is offline THEN all database operations SHALL continue to function normally
3. WHEN accessing stored data THEN no internet connection SHALL be required
4. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the local database SHALL be removed with the app data
