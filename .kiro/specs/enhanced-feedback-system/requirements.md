# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Feedback System improves the user experience of the Zener card game by providing more engaging and immediate feedback when players make their guesses. Instead of simple text messages, the system will display prominent overlay notifications with "Hit!" or "Miss" text that appears above all other UI elements, accompanied by haptic feedback to create a more immersive gaming experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see prominent visual feedback when I make a correct guess, so that I feel rewarded and engaged with the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user makes a correct guess THEN the system SHALL display "Hit!" text as an overlay on top of all other UI elements
2. WHEN the "Hit!" overlay appears THEN the system SHALL position it prominently in the center of the screen
3. WHEN the "Hit!" text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a high z-index to ensure it appears above all other content
4. WHEN the correct guess feedback is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the overlay for 1-2 seconds before automatically dismissing it

### Requirement 2

3. WHEN the "Miss" text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a high z-index to ensure it appears above all other content
4. WHEN the incorrect guess feedback is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain the overlay for 1-2 seconds before automatically dismissing it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to feel haptic feedback when I make guesses, so that the game feels more responsive and engaging on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the user makes an incorrect guess THEN the system SHALL trigger haptic feedback on the device

3. WHEN either overlay appears THEN the system SHALL include smooth fade-in and fade-out animations
4. WHEN the overlay is active THEN the system SHALL ensure it does not interfere with the underlying game interface functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the enhanced feedback to work seamlessly with the existing game flow, so that the game remains smooth and responsive.
